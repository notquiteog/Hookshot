# Temporal history validity

DLSS and FSR4 use the shared temporal chain; FSR3.1 prepares its own inputs. If camera reprojection fails, motion vectors are unavailable and the previous picture has no valid mapping to the current one. Each path must deliver a reset in that same frame rather than retaining unusable history.

Validate both input matrices and each result coefficient before converting to float. A finite double outside the float range is rejected before conversion. Preserve the existing algorithm, singularity threshold and age/size rules: valid consecutive camera motion retains history. This adds no camera-cut heuristic or interface change.

The game-free fixture compiles actual reprojection math, both preparation policies, the shared frame reset and all three consumer assignments (DLSS, FSR4, FSR3.1). It covers singular and non-finite inputs, float overflow/boundaries, recovery, frame gaps, FSR3.1 size changes and valid perspectives at16:9 and ultrawide. Engine SDKs and a GPU are not required. CPU cases do not prove in-game frequency, visual gains or GPU handling of injected invalid matrices.

## PsychoV35 with DLSS/DLAA and FSR 4 (opt-in)

`RX_VK_PSYCHOV35_DLSS=1` lets NVIDIA DLSS/DLAA and AMD FSR 4 (and its Native AA) take the Native HDR PsychoV35 scene, whose gameplay network input and output are RGBA16F (`upscaler_rows.h` `takes_psychov35`: the engines the chain gives linear light in an HDR context). It is off by default. Vanilla's packed B10G11R11 route is unchanged; this switch does not enable PsychoV35 for FSR 3.1 or TAAU.

The pre-existing Upscaler Off stretch also only writes packed output, so Off with PsychoV35 still falls back to the
game's network, even at 100%. It must not be labelled native with no anti-aliasing in a benchmark. This
switch does not change that route; Vanilla with Off and 100% provides the true native, no-upscaling comparison.

The network's perceptual colour encoding still needs the existing HDR prep square to linear light, even though the scene tone-map pass itself writes linear colour. Storage precision does not determine that encoding. The typed RGBA16F output pass writes the engine's linear result without squaring again. FSR 4 takes the same pair: its context is made for HDR, linear colour while the game presents PQ (`vk_fsr4.cpp`), and the route waits for that context as DLSS's waits for its HDR feature (`RX_VK_FSR4_HDR=0` prevents it). Changing the tone mapper or input format resets history.

Regenerate the output variant with glslang 16.6.0:

```sh
python -I -B tests/test_psychov35_dlss.py --write --glslang glslang --cxx clang++
```

The existing packed output header is unchanged. `tests/test_psychov35_dlss.py` checks the opt-in format pairs, the same policy at camera/actor/reactive consumers, history resets, HDR prep selection and the compiled output's RGBA16F storage image type.

### Hookshot review and NVIDIA frame generation

This path adapts [Hookshot #2707](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/pull/2707),
head `f1d654ce6f841fd4ce5bcbbe8900629a5394e484`, by nooblikejagger. It is an open draft at the time of review.
Its author reports a successful RTX 4070 SUPER HDR-display test for DLSS, but no controlled performance comparison
or NVIDIA frame-generation measurement. Those results do not validate this port (Longshot #108 and #247, taken here).

[Hookshot #2481](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/pull/2481) introduced PsychoV35 and deliberately narrowed
RGBA16F to Native HDR plus PsychoV35. Its discussion confirms that selecting DLSS and frame generation in the menu
did not prove they ran: the log revealed the format rejection and fallback. [Hookshot #2243](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/pull/2243)
established the native-HDR DLSS encoding; its author confirmed that it landed through
[Hookshot #2342](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/pull/2342). Removing the format
check alone would leave a packed-format storage shader bound to an RGBA16F image. Skipping the prep decode because
storage is floating point would instead change brightness.

[Hookshot #2118](https://github.com/NotRexed/Hookshot/pull/2118), merged, supplies the NGX frame-generation path
already in this tree. It takes the temporal chain's inputs and logs successful and fallback sets every 600 presents.
Here, `temporal_upscale` calls `dlss_fg_inputs` after a successful evaluation and output dispatch. That function
copies the frame's depth and motion and carries its camera and history reset; it does not inspect the scene colour format.
When the chain rejects RGBA16F, no new inputs reach it and `dlss_fg_frames` falls back with `FG_SKIP_INPUTS`.
Accepting the scene restores this handoff. Existing GPU/runtime support, fixed-multiplier, gap and maximum-frame checks
still apply; accepting RGBA16F does not promise that every present can use NVIDIA frame generation.

Runtime validation must start cold with Native HDR, PsychoV35, DLSS/DLAA, the switch above and a supported fixed NVIDIA
frame-generation multiplier. Verify the HDR feature creation, the log line `vk: PsychoV35 DLSS: RGBA16F linear route`
with network input and output format 97, repeated DLSS drawn-frame counts and `DLSS Frame Gen (NGX)` made-frame counts.
Compare against the switch off and Vanilla in the same scene, then switch tone mappers and DLSS/DLAA during play. Check
brightness on an HDR display, edges, actor motion, history resets and validation errors. With FSR 4 or its Native AA, the log
line is `vk: PsychoV35 FSR 4: RGBA16F linear route`, the status lines count `AMD FSR 4 ...: N frames drawn`, and no
`the game's upscale runs` follows; there is no NVIDIA frame generation to check. A transitional packed-format
frame after a hot switch is insufficient evidence; a menu selection alone is insufficient too. Record measured runs in
`tested-configurations.md`.
