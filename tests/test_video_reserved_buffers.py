"""A video buffer acquired before its picture is reserved: the next picture decoded goes into it, and its sync is reached
then, not before (host/nn_video.c, from SYNC_RESERVED_TAG to dec_submit).

Before, such a buffer's sync was reached at the next submission while that submission's picture went to the next
acquire: Donkey Kong Bananza's guide-movie player counted one buffer done more than the pictures it had sent, found no
entry for it (main+0xe1ada0) and aborted after a loop or a few. The section is cut from the source and compiled with
stand-ins for the decoding (decode_pending, put_picture) and the system events. Checks:

- a reservation's handle is not reached; a sync point event asked for it waits;
- with nothing decoded, nothing is filled; a decoded picture goes into the reserved buffer, the handle is reached and
  the event signalled;
- two reservations are filled in the order they were made, whatever their buffer indexes;
- a reservation given up (the buffer released) is reached, and its event signalled;
- any other handle (0, the hardware's done fences) is reached, and its event due at once.
